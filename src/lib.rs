//! A crate providing data structures for square-tiled grids wrapped around the surface of certain objects.
//! This create was intended to be used for the creation of cellular automata on non-flat grids.
//! The crate provides a trait `SurfaceGrid` with an associated type `Point` which can be used to traverse the grid squares.
//! Additionally, for grids that wrap a sphere the `Point` type implements the `SpherePoint` trait providing conversions
//! between geographic and surface grid coordinates.
//! 
//! ## Available Surfaces
//! ### Spheres
//! - `RectangleSphereGrid` - Uses an equirectangular projection to wrap a rectangle around the sphere.
//! - `CubeSphereGrid` - Projects a cube over the sphere with each face being a square grid.
